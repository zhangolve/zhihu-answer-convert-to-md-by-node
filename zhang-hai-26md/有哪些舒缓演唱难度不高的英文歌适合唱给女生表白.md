 竟然没人提酷玩Coldplay的yellow，应该不难唱吧，曾经想在ktv唱，然而曲库没有这首。  

歌词奉上：  
YELLOW  
Look at the stars 仰望天上的星星  
Look how they shine for you 看着它们为你绽放光芒  
And everything you do  
Yeah, they were all yellow 而你却如此胆怯小心  

I came along 跟随着你  
I wrote a song for you 我为你写下了一首情歌  
And all the things you do 因为你表现出的胆怯小心  
And it was called yellow 歌名叫做"黄色"  

So then I took my turn 我会全心全意  
Oh what a thing to have done 想突破你的心房赢得你的芳心  
And it was all yellow 却也担心害怕起来  

Your skin, oh yeah your skin and bones 你的肌肤  
Turn into something beautiful 是如此的美丽脱俗而真实  
D'you know? 你该知道  
You know I love you so 我不可自拔的爱上了你  
You know I love you so 你该明了我已经深深地爱上了你  

I swam across 整个心早已游向你  
I jumped across for you 整个人急着想飞奔到你面前却又却步  
Oh what a thing to do 不知如何靠近你  
'Cos you were all yellow 因为你是如此胆怯小心  

I drew a line 我画出你的肖像  
I drew a line for you 我画下了你的样子  
Oh what a thing to do 却不知该如何表示  
And it was all yellow 因为你是如此胆怯小心  

And your skin, oh yeah your skin and bones 你的肌肤  
Turn into something beautiful 是如此美丽脱俗而真实  
D'you know? 你该知道  
For you I bleed myself dry 我愿为你抛开一切  
For you I bleed myself dry 你该明了,我为你失去生命也不可惜  

It's true 这是真的  
Look how they shine for you 星星都因为你绽放光芒  
Look how they shine for you 星星都因为你绽放光芒  
Look how they shine for you 看!它们都为你绽放光芒  
Look how they shine for you 看!它们都为你绽放光芒  
Look how they shine for you 星星都因为你绽放光芒  
Look how they shine  

Look at the stars 仰望天上的星星  
Look how they shine for you 看着它们为你绽放光芒  
And all the things that you do 而你却如此胆怯小心  

这个是著名台湾填词人姚谦翻译的。
